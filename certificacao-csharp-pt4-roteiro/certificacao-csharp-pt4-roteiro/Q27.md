You need to adjust the loanRate value to meet the requirements

You are evaluating a method that calculates loan interest. The application includes the
following code segment. (Line numbers are included for reference only.)

```
private static decimal CalculateInterest(decimal loanAmount, int loanTerm)
{
    decimal interestAmount;
    decimal loanRate;
    if (loanTerm > 0 && loanTerm < 5 && loanAmount < 5000m)
    {
        loanRate = 0.045m;
    }
    else if (loanTerm > 5 && loanAmount > 5000m)
    {
        loanRate = 0.085m;
    }
    else
    {
        loanRate = 0.055m;
    }
    interestAmount = loanAmount * loanRate * loanTerm;
    return interestAmount;
}
```


When the loanTerm value is 5 and the loanAmount value is 4500, the loanRate must be set
to 6.5 percent. You need to adjust the loanRate value to meet the requirements.
What should you do?

A.
Replace line 15 with the following code segment: 
loanRate = 0.065m;

B.
Replace line 07 with the following code segment: 
loanRate = 0.065m;

C.
Replace line 17 with the following code segment: 
interestAmount = loanAmount * 0.065m * loanTerm;

D.
Replace line 04 with the following code segment: 
decimal loanRate = 0.065m;
