Which two actions should you perform?

You are modifying an application that processes leases. The following code defines the
Lease class. (Line numbers are included for reference only.)

```
01 public class Lease
02 {
03 
04     private int _term;
05     private const int MaximumTerm = 5;
06     private const decimal Rate = 0.034m;
07     public int Term
08     {
09         get
10         {
11          return _term;
12         }
13         set
14         {
15             if (value <= MaximumTerm)
16             {
17                 _term = value;
18             }
19             else
20             {
21 
22             }
23         }
24     }
25 }
26 public delegate void MaximumTermReachedHandler(object source, EventArgs e);
```

Leases are restricted to a maximum term of 5 years. The application must send a notification
message if a lease request exceeds 5 years.
You need to implement the notification mechanism.
Which two actions should you perform? (Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
Choose two.)

```
A. Insert the following code segment at line 03:
public event MaximumTermReachedHandler OnMaximumTermReached;

B. Insert the following code segment at line 21:
if (OnMaximumTermReached != null)
{
    OnMaximumTermReached(this, new EventArgs () ):
}

C. Insert the following code segment at line 21:
value = MaximumTerm;

D. Insert the following code segment at line 03:
public string MaximumTermReachedEvent { get; set; }

E. Insert the following code segment at line 03:
private string MaximumTermReachedEvent;

F. Insert the following code segment at line 21:
value = 4;
```
