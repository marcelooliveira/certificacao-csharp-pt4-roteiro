How should you complete the relevant code?

DRAG DROP
You develop an application that displays information from log files when errors occur. The
application will prompt the user to create an error report that sends details about the error
and the session to the administrator.
When a user opens a log file by using the application, the application throws an exception
and closes.
The application must preserve the original stack trace information when an exception occurs
during this process.
You need to implement the method that reads the log files.
