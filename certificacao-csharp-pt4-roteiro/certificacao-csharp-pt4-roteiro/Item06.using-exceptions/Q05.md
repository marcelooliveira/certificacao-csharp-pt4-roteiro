How should you complete the relevant code?

DRAG DROP
You are developing an application that implements a set of custom exception types. You
declare the custom exception types by using the following code segments:

```
public class AdventureWorksException : System.Exception { ... }
public class AdventureWorksDbException : AdventureWorksException { ... }
public class AdventureWorksValidationException : AdventureWorksException { ... }
```

The application includes a function named DoWork that throws .NET Framework exceptions
and custom exceptions.
The application contains only the following logging methods:

```
static void Log(Exception ex) { ... }
static void Log(AdventureWorksException ex) { ... }
static void Log(AdventureWorkSValidationException ex) { ... }
```

The application must meet the following requirements:
When AdventureWorksValidationException exceptions are caught, log the information by
using the static void Log (AdventureWorksValidationException ex) method.
When AdventureWorksDbException or other AdventureWorksException exceptions are
caught, log the information by using the static void I oq( AdventureWorksException ex)
method.
You need to meet the requirements.
How should you complete the relevant code? (To answer, drag the appropriate code
segments to the correct locations in the answer area. Each code segment may be used
once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or
scroll to view content.)

```
(Exception ex)
(AdventureWorksException ex)
(AdventureWorksValidationException ex)
(AdventureWorksException ex)
```

```
try
{
    DoWork();
}
catch [LACUNA 1]
{
    Log(ex);
}
catch [LACUNA 2]
{
    Log(ex);
}
catch [LACUNA 3]
{
    Log(ex);
}
```
