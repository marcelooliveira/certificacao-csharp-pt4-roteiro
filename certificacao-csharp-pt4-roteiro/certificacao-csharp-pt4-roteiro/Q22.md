RESPOSTA: B

Explanation:
When the C# compiler encounters an #if directive, followed eventually by an #endif directive,
it will compile the code between the directives only if the specified symbol is defined. Unlike
C and C++, you cannot assign a numeric value to a symbol; the #if statement in C# is
Boolean and only tests whether the symbol has been defined or not. For example,
#define DEBUG
// …
#if DEBUG
Console.WriteLine(“Debug version”);
#endif
